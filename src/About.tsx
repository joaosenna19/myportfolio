      <p className="text-color mb-2 text-justify text-base font-light">
        I've been passionate about technology since 2002 (4 years old) when I
        started exploring the world of computers, particularly video games. Even
        back then, using a desktop with Windows 2000, I was already engaged in
        educational games like "Reader Rabbit." During adolescence, my interest
        expanded to programming, and for fun, I developed alternative servers
        for the game Ragnarok Online.

        Despite my love for technology, I chose to study law and worked in the
        legal field for 4 years, serving as a corporate advisor and
        participating in mergers and acquisitions. In 2021, during a work trip,
        I had the opportunity to sit down with developers and rediscover my
        passion for computing.

        Since then, I have dedicated myself to studying and acquiring
        qualifications to enter the technology industry. While my familiarity
        with JavaScript technologies is strong, I believe programming languages,
        libraries, and frameworks are tools to develop meaningful solutions for
        real-world problems. In 2023, I made the decision to move to Calgary,
        where I am excited to explore new opportunities in the technology field.
        Besides my passion for programming, I also enjoy activities such as
        playing tennis, Magic The Gathering and reading fantasy books in my free
        time. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing and growing
        professionally in this new phase of my career.
